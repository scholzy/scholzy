ðŸ™‹ G'day, Iâ€™m @scholzy aka Michael Scholz, a Japanese-Australian living in London

ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry at UCL

ðŸ”¦ By day, I shoot lasers at chemicals that make animals glow to study them using photoelectron spectroscopy

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m fascinated by using code &mdash; predominantly Julia and Python &mdash; to solve physics problems
